# Avito clone by Dima

This is a project by me, clone of original Avito website. Training & learning in HTML,CSS,JS. Learning markdown.

## Project structure

Webpage will be divided to parts. From top to bottom as the site goes:
*Header
*Main
\*Footer

All parts(body,header,footer) will be wrapper in containers( inner & outer).
As the time goes by, and i will keep adding new parts, they can be locally divided from the main page as well for some time.

### Main Page link in repository

[Main Page](../avitoCLone/index.html)

## How to open:

1. Download full repository [repository_link](https://github.com/Kukarazi/avit0_clone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip it.
3. Then, you can launch "C:\..\avitoCLone\index.html" and other html files ( if updates requires so) directly in your browser.
